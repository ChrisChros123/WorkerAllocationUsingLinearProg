# WorkerAllocationUsingLinearProgramming
Transformation of the worker-to-task allocation problem into a linear program. 

In the worker allocation problem, we wish to minimize the total time T needed to finish s tasks having r workers 
at our disposal. The given data must contain the information, what ratio $\p_{i,j}$ of task j woker i can finish in one hour.
